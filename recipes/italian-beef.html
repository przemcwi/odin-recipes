    <p>Best homemade Italian beef I have ever had. My mom always made it, and she passed this recipe down to me. It's so good!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>3 (1 ounce) packages dry Italian salad dressing mix</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar pepperoncini peppers</li>
        <li>8 hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place roast into a slow cooker and rub dressing mix over top. Pour water around roast. Cover and cook on High until meat is tender and can be easily pulled apart with a fork, 5 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove meat and shred with two forks. Return meat to the slow cooker; add pepperoncini and as much pepperoncini juice as you like for additional flavor. Cover and cook for 1 more hour.</li>
